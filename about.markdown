I am Arshed Nabeel, an independent researcher interested in neuroscience, deep representation learning, and the intersection of the two. In my most recent avatar, I was a deep learning research engineer at Netradyne, developing tools and techniques to analyze driver behavior. Previously, I was at Indian Institute of Science, exploring functional neuroimaging, neural signals, and their timescales.

In my free time, I obsess over Formula 1 (rooting for Lando Norris and McLaren, conveniently ignoring the fact that Merecdes is going to be the champions for at least another couple of years) and make slightly-better-than-mediocre digital artwork. I also sometimes find niches of geek fandoms to dig into; the most recent being _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ and _Sandman_.
