I am Arshed Nabeel, an independent researcher interested problems at the intersection of computer science, applied math and basic sciences. In my most recent avatar, I was a deep learning research engineer at Netradyne, developing tools and techniques to analyze driver behavior. Previously, I was at Indian Institute of Science, exploring functional neuroimaging, neural signals, and their timescales. In my past adventures, I have also dabbled in other fields like computer science theory and mathematical ecology.

In my free time, I obsess over Formula 1 or make slightly-better-than-mediocre digital artwork. I also sometimes find pop-culture topics of varying degrees of obscurity to dig into, which can vary in scope; some of the recent ones are the history of computing (especially videogames), the works of _Studio Ghibli_, and Neil Gaiman's _Sandman_.
