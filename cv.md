# Projects

2014 May -- 2015 May \\
**Parameterized Algorithms for Social Choice Problems** \\
Under the guidance of Dr. Neeldhara Misra, Department of CSA, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore \\
_Thesis dissertation project performed as part of the Master of Engineering program at IISc. We examined the problem of approval-voting through the lens of parameterized complexity. Part of this work was published in AAMAS 2015 (see [publications](/publications/))._

2015 August -- 2018 April \\
**Functional Dynamics of Human Brain Networks** \\
Under the guidance of Prof. Sridharan Devarajan (Center for Neuroscience) and Prof. Arnab Bhattacharyya (Department of CSA), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore\\
_Graduate research performed as part of doctoral study, discontinued. We studied the structure and dynamics of functional networks underlying human brain activity, using a combination of theoretical tools and neuroimaging data analysis. Part of this work was published in NeurIPS 2017 (see [publications](/publications/))._

2018 December -- 2019 March \\
**Predictive Analysis of Turning Behavior in Schools of Fish** \\
Under the guidance of [Dr. Danny M Raj](https://www.dannyraj.com/), Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Insitute of Science, Bangalore \\
_Reseach performed as part of a Research Associate appointment. We analyzed the movement and turning behavior of schools of fish, built predictive models, and used them to gain insights into the collective dynamics of the school._

2020 January -- \\
**Observing and Inferring a Collective** \\
Under the guidance of [Dr. Danny M Raj](https://www.dannyraj.com/), Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Instiute of Science, Bangalore \\
_We study the movement of agents in a collective system, trying to understand how much we can learn about the individual agents from observed data about the collective.__

\\
**Seatbelt Detection, Warning and Compliance Analysis** \\
Work done while at Netradyne. \\
_Developed and maintained an end-to-end solution to detect, from a video feed, when drivers are driving without seatbelt, provide alerts as appropriate, and assign seatbelt compliance scores. The project involved developing, training and deploying deep neural networks, writing and maintaining code to run seatbelt detection logic on edge-devices, and writing pipelines to analyze large datasets (collected over a period of time) to generate compliance reports._

**Driver Drowsiness Detection** \\
Work done while at Netrayne. \\
_Designed and developed an experimental driver drowsiness detection pipeline that uses both visual cues and driving patterns to detect when the driver is drowsy and provide alerts as appropriate._
