On [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/arshednabeel), I tweet stuff about science, neuroscience, machine learning, Formula 1, and sometimes other random things.

I occasionally make sketches and artwork, digital and otherwise. The better ones can be found on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eigenhuman/) profile.

I very rarely write blog-posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arshednabeel), the subject matter of which vary wildly. Attempts to consistently blog about one chosen topic has so far been unsucessful, but I am starting to like it this way.
