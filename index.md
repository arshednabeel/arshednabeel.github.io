Hello! I am Arshed Nabeel, an independent researcher interested in problems at the intersection of computer science, applied math and basic sciences. In my most recent avatar, I was a deep learning research engineer at Netradyne, developing tools and techniques to analyze driver behavior. Previously, I was at Indian Institute of Science, exploring functional neuroimaging, neural signals, and their timescales.
