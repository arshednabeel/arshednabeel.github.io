We demonstrate that the problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the size of the committee to be chosen, but does admit a FPT algorithm when parameterized by the number of strings that is more eﬃcient than the previous ILP-based approaches for the problem. We also consider several combinations of parameters and provide a detailed landscape of the parameterized and kernelization complexity of the problem. We also study the version of the problem where we permit outliers, that is, where the chosen committee is required to satisfy a large number of voters (instead of all of them). In this context, we strengthen an APX-hardness result in the literature, and also show a simple but strong W-hardness result.},

	abstract = {Brain processes occur at various timescales, ranging from milliseconds (neurons) to minutes and hours (behavior). Characterizing functional coupling among brain regions at these diverse timescales is key to understanding how the brain produces behavior. Here, we apply instantaneous and lag-based measures of conditional linear dependence, based on Granger-Geweke causality (GC), to infer network connections at distinct timescales from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Due to the slow sampling rate of fMRI, it is widely held that GC produces spurious and unreliable estimates of functional connectivity when applied to fMRI data. We challenge this claim with simulations and a novel machine learning approach. First, we show, with simulated fMRI data, that instantaneous and lag-based GC identify distinct timescales and complementary patterns of functional connectivity. Next, we analyze fMRI scans from 500 subjects and show that a linear classiﬁer trained on either instantaneous or lag-based GC connectivity reliably distinguishes task versus rest brain states, with ∼80-85\% cross-validation accuracy. Importantly, instantaneous and lag-based GC exploit markedly different spatial and temporal patterns of connectivity to achieve robust classiﬁcation. Our approach enables identifying functionally connected networks that operate at distinct timescales in the brain.},

              Coarse-grained descriptions of collective motion of flocking systems are often derived for the macroscopic or the thermodynamic limit. However, the size of many real flocks falls within ‘mesoscopic’ scales (10 to 100 individuals), where stochasticity arising from the finite flock sizes is important. Previous studies on mesoscopic models have typically focused on non-spatial models. Developing mesoscopic scale equations, typically in the form of stochastic differential equations, can be challenging even for the simplest of the collective motion models that explicitly account for space. To address this gap, here, we take a novel data-driven equation learning approach to construct the stochastic mesoscopic descriptions of a simple, spatial, self-propelled particle (SPP) model of collective motion. In the spatial model, a focal individual can interact with
              k
              randomly chosen neighbours within an interaction radius. We consider
              k
               = 1 (called stochastic pairwise interactions),
              k
               = 2 (stochastic ternary interactions), and
              k
              equalling all available neighbours within the interaction radius (equivalent to Vicsek-like local averaging). For the stochastic pairwise interaction model, the data-driven mesoscopic equations reveal that the collective order is driven by a multiplicative noise term (hence termed, noise-induced flocking). In contrast, for higher order interactions (
              k
               {\textgreater} 1), including Vicsek-like averaging interactions, models yield collective order driven by a combination of deterministic and stochastic forces. We find that the relation between the parameters of the mesoscopic equations describing the dynamics and the population size are sensitive to the density and to the interaction radius, exhibiting deviations from mean-field theoretical expectations. We provide semi-analytic arguments potentially explaining these observed deviations. In summary, our study emphasises the importance of mesoscopic descriptions of flocking systems and demonstrates the potential of the data-driven equation discovery methods for complex systems studies.},

	abstract = {Collective movement is observed widely in nature, where individuals interact locally to produce globally ordered, coherent motion. In typical models of collective motion, each individual takes the average direction of multiple neighbors, resulting in ordered movement. In small flocks, noise induced order can also emerge with individuals copying only a randomly chosen single neighbor at a time. We propose a new model of collective movement, inspired by how real animals move, where individuals can move in two directions or remain stationary. We demonstrate that when individuals interact with a single neighbor through a novel form of halting interaction -- where an individual may stop upon encountering an oppositely moving neighbor rather than instantly aligning -- persistent collective order can emerge even in large populations. This represents a fundamentally different mechanism from conventional averaging-based or noise-induced ordering. Using deterministic and stochastic mean-field approximations, we characterize the conditions under which such ``flocking by stopping'' behavior can occur, and confirm the mean-field predictions using individual-based simulations. Our results highlight how incorporating a stopped state and halting interactions can generate new routes to order in collective movement.},

	abstract = {Most real-world collectives, including animal groups, pedestrian crowds, active particles, and living cells, are heterogeneous. The differences among individuals in their intrinsic properties have emergent effects at the group level. It is often of interest to infer how the intrinsic properties differ among the individuals based on their observed movement patterns. However, the true individual properties may be masked by the nonlinear interactions in the collective. We investigate the inference problem in the context of a bidisperse collective with two types of agents, where the goal is to observe the motion of the collective and classify the agents according to their types. Since collective effects, such as jamming and clustering, affect individual motion, the information in an agent’s own movement is insufficient for accurate classification. A simple observer algorithm, based only on individual velocities, cannot accurately estimate the level of heterogeneity of the system and often misclassifies agents. We propose a novel approach to the classification problem, where collective effects on an agent’s motion are explicitly accounted for. We use insights about the phenomenology of collective motion to quantify the effect of the neighborhood on an agent’s motion using a neighborhood parameter. Such an approach can distinguish between agents of two types, even when their observed motion is identical. This approach estimates the level of heterogeneity much more accurately and achieves significant improvements in classification. Our results demonstrate that explicitly accounting for neighborhood effects is often necessary to correctly infer intrinsic properties of individuals.},
