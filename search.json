    "text": "My research interests sit at the intersection of biology, computer science and applied mathematics. My research follows two broad themes that often interleave:\nCollective behaviour and emergent phenomena. I am fascinated by how complex emergent group behaviours can result from interactions among simple units. I have studied collective emergent phenomena in various systems such as brain networks, droplet assemblies and fish schools.\nData driven modelling. In my research, I develop and use techniques to discover models from empirical data. I am a strong proponent of combining of data- and theory-driven modelling approaches to answer questions about complex natural systems."

    "text": "Collective movement of fish schools\nFor my Ph. D. research, I study the collective movement of fish schools, using a combination of data-driven and theoretical approaches. The Theoretical Ecology and Evolution (TEE) Lab at IISc, with its remarkable mix of experimentalists and theorists, makes this research possible.\nUnifying principles of collective movement in fish schools. I analyzed the movement trajectories of over a dozen different species of fish to understand generalisable patterns and principles underlying their collective movement. Insights from this analysis lead to new models of collective movement in fish, where variable speed plays a crucial role in the emergent dynamics  [1].\n\n[1] Y. Kumar KC, A. Nabeel, S. Iyer, and V. Guttal, Flocking by stopping: A novel mechanism of emergent order in collective movement, (2026).\nCollective movement of mixed-species fish schools. The movement models developed above gives rise to novel predictions about the schooling behaviour of mixed-species schools, where different species differ slightly in their behaviour. These predictions match remarkably well with actual experimental data from mixed-species schools. (with Jahanvi Tiwari)"

However, the technique is quite general: I have since then started collaborations where we apply the techique to other problems, such as population dynamics of fish populations in the wide. I will hopefully have more to say on this soon!"
